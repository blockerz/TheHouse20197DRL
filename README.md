# The House 2019 7DRL

### A game made in 7 days for 2019 7 Day Roguelike Challenge.

You can download it on [Itch.io](https://blockerz.itch.io/the-house-2019-7drl)

I created a short talk about the dungeon generator and 7DRL here: [The House 2019 Developer Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwPzRbSWpWY). 

There is a walkthrough here: [The House 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4L4jgvJTRs).

It leverages some of the code for the [RogueSharp Unity Port] (https://github.com/Olivexe/RogueSharpTutorialUnityPort) which is an extension of [RogueSharp](https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/). 

I used two fonts [Haunted by Manfred Klein](https://www.dafont.com/haunted.font) and [Komiko by Agustian Eko Saputro](https://www.1001freefonts.com/komiko.font).

All art was done by me during the 7 day timeframe. 

I used C# in Unity. Because it was a jam with a time limit and no plan for extension, many shortcuts were required. 

I used a Wang Tile set for room connectivity. Some of the ideas I got about how to piece it together came from this excellent site on [Blob Tilesets](http://cr31.co.uk/stagecast/wang/blob.html).
